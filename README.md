## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You could start by editing `app/page.tsx`... but why would you want to start there?

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [engram platform](https://engram.sh/?ref=wayjake) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Engram deployment documentation](https://engramhq.xyz/docs/get-started/) for more details.
